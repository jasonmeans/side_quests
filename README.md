# side_quests

This repository is your `#2` playground/sandbox repo.

## Purpose
- Store prototypes, system diagrams, and experimental spikes
- Validate ideas quickly before they graduate into dedicated repositories
- Keep iteration speed high with low process overhead

## Current Layout
- `prototypes/`: throwaway experiments and MVP spikes
- `system_designs/`: architecture notes and diagrams (including Mermaid)
- `docs/`: lightweight operating notes for this sandbox
- `repos/`: local scaffolds for the two additional repositories

## Governance
- Production-grade work should move to a dedicated repo (`skills-learnings` or `discogs-app`)
- Keep this repo intentionally fast-moving and disposable
- Every experiment should have a short README with goal, status, and next step
