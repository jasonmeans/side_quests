# Repository Strategy

## Target Repositories
1. `skills-learnings` (`#1`, deep focus)
2. `side_quests` (`#2`, sandbox/playground)
3. `discogs-app` (`#3`, product/application)

## Ownership Boundary
- `skills-learnings`: long-lived personal operating system for skill growth, learning logs, and AI-assisted workflows
- `side_quests`: experiments and design ideation only
- `discogs-app`: product code, roadmap, and release execution

## Promotion Rule
- New ideas begin in `side_quests`
- If an idea is strategic and durable, migrate to the right dedicated repo within 7 days
