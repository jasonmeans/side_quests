# Prototypes & Experiments

This folder is a playground for conducting prototypes, MVPs, and experimental code. 

Use this space to:
- Build quick proof-of-concepts
- Test new technologies and frameworks
- Create minimal viable products (MVPs)
- Experiment with different approaches and solutions

Feel free to iterate, break things, and explore without the constraints of production code.
